            <p>Hi there! My name is Faunie Szelocze, I was born in Tatabanya, Hungary on December 25th, 1987 at 5:30 pm. People often ask me where I'm from, 29 years later you would think I'd have the answer to this querstion down. The truth is, I'm not sure. I lived in Hungary for the first 6 yeras of my life, after that we spent my entire childhood moving around. I went to 9 different school between 1st and 12th grade. But, I often say Denver, Colorado becuase that's where I went to highschool for an ENTIRE 4 years. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, this lifestyle has continued into my adult life and I have spent many years traveling, moving around, doing contract work and just enjoying the world. I now proudly reside in Portland, Oregon with my Partner Sarge, my cat Simba and my lovely dog Luna-Belle. I hope to call this place my "forever home.""</p>
